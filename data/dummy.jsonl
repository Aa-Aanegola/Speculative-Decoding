Spitting, kicking and hitting. Ripping books. Brandishing scissors.\nThese are some of the behaviors educators say are increasing in Oregon classrooms.\nTeachers have voiced concerns to the Oregon Education Association over the past few years about disruptive behaviors that not only affect the student doing those things, but also have lasting effects on their peers and educators.\nThe association released a report Tuesday detailing what they call \"a crisis of disruptive learning.\"\nThe report delves into these behaviors, what might be causing them and what actions the teachers' union recommends schools, districts, state lawmakers and governmental agencies take to help.\n\"Now more than ever, we need funding to make sure students get what they need,\" said John Larson, high school English teacher and president of the Oregon Education Association.\n\"We also have to realize today ... we have many students with unmet needs,\" he said. \"Housing insecurity, food insecurity, unmet mental-health needs. They have needs in- and outside of school that many of our members are not equipped to deal to with.\"\nSchool district administrators and Oregon Department of Education staff had not seen the report Monday and could not comment in time for publication.\n\"While we have not had the opportunity to review the findings, we are committed to building social and emotional learning in Salem-Keizer Public Schools,\" said Lillian Govus, director of communications for the district.\n\"By truly understanding what is driving students' behaviors \u2014 not just in Salem-Keizer but across the region \u2014 we can develop appropriate responses that minimize disruptions and maintain safe educational spaces for our educators and our children,\" she said.\nThe report was released just two weeks into Oregon's 2019 legislative session.\nLawmakers are expected to have a large focus on education, especially since the Joint Committee on Student Success is set to develop a comprehensive budget and policy road map to improve K-12 schools.\nColt Gill, director of the Oregon Department of Education, attended the meeting at South Salem High School in November and said there may be legislative opportunities to make these changes happen.\nLarson said the association will make sure every legislator has a copy of this report.\nWhile the association estimates another $4 billion over the current service level is needed per biennium to get pre-K through higher education where they need to be, Larson recognized it has to be a long-term, sustainable investment and it won't happen immediately.\nThe report includes feedback from from hundreds of educators around Oregon. The association, in partnership with the Oregon Department of Education, hosted 14 forums and heard from hundreds of participants online, officials said.\n\"Oregon is filled with quality educators, quality support professionals who care about every student,\" he said. \"But the conditions in our school make it nearly impossible for them to do their jobs successful.\n\"We need to make sure we aren't selling our future short.\"\nAccording to the report, a disruptive learning environment is defined when student behavior significantly interferes with instruction and/or school staff members' ability to maintain a stable classroom or ensure student safety.\nAt times, these behaviors can become dangerous to the student exhibiting them, or the classroom as a whole.\nThe report lists myriad negative behaviors educators see regularly \u2014 verbal abuse, person-to-person abuse, weaponizing the classroom and destruction of property.\nAt listening sessions across the state, educators told the association about the \"atmosphere of violence that was palpable,\" of attacks that came regularly and of trauma students experience in that environment.\nAnd while these behaviors may not all be new, educators have reported an increase in the severity and frequency in recent years.\nSchool districts are not required to keep formal data on incidents like \"room clears.\"\nA room clear is when students temporarily leave a classroom to reduce the likelihood of injury or trauma as a result of extreme behavior. This typically happens when one student is exhibiting behavior that puts the rest of the class at risk.\nThe association surveyed educators and students across Oregon on these issues.\nOf the respondents, 32 percent said they were scared for students' safety at school, 25 percent said they were concerned for their own safety and 56 percent said their classroom or their child's classroom had experienced at least one room clear this year.\nAnecdotally though, many families, administrators and staff have reported to the association that weekly or daily room clears have become commonplace, according to the report.\nAnd according to the bi-annual poll called the Oregon Teaching, Empowering, Leading and Learning survey, educators feel less safe now than they did in 2014, with the percentage of staff who agreed the environment they work in is safe dropping from 92 percent in 2014 to 82 percent in 2018.\n\"There is not a reliable, timely or effective system in place to intervene when there are consistent disruptions,\" one respondent told the association. \"It feels like a Band-Aid approach.\"\nThese behaviors can affect everyone in the classroom.\nThe student exhibiting the behaviors often lose instructional time and needed supports, and educators said they can experience social isolation and emotional trauma as a result of how peers treat them in the aftermath of the events.\nThe students witnessing or being harmed by the behaviors also lose out on instructional time, when Oregon already has one of the shortest school years in the country.\nSome of these peers have been physically injured. According to the report, others have a hard time learning even when an event isn't occurring due to the stress or fear that something will.\nEducators told the association they feel discouraged \"that often the only intervention available is for students to be removed from class and 'babysat' in an office, rather than addressing their unmet needs or receive tools to manage their behavior.\"\n\"Quite honestly, this is a community problem,\" Larson said. \"This is something that we really need to solve together.\n\"Our students are at risk,\" he said. \"We need to make sure they are safe and able to learn.\"\nWhen asked \"Why do disrupted learning environments occur?\", one participant wrote, \"More problems and less support.\"\nThe association said decades of \"chronic and systemic disinvestment in Oregon schools\" is perhaps the most influential reason for this, pointing to the fact that, over the last two decades, the Legislature has consistently financed schools at about 21 to 38 percent below what its own research suggested districts needed to be successful.\nHowever, the report also lists a number of other contributing factors, including increased class sizes; decreased student support specialists; students with high needs but no resources to support them; a marked decreased in \"well-rounded education opportunities\" and time for physical activity; a lack of appropriate training for educators and an \"unclear implementation of policies regarding restraint and seclusion, k-5 expulsion and suspension\" and protocols for disruptions.\nNot every district is affected by all of these factors, though.\nFor example, large class sizes are a significant issue in districts like Salem-Keizer Public Schools, which recently passed a capital-construction bond and is planning to change boundaries to address overcrowding.\nHowever, smaller, rural districts aren't usually battling large classes. Instead, they may be facing increased percentages of students who are living in poverty and experiencing homelessness or food insecurity.\nAnd even within one school and one classroom, every student will have their own background and experiences.\n\"It's different for every, single child,\" Larson said, adding that's why the state needs more professional development to help better prepare staff. He said additional adults in the classroom and, in some cases, improved curriculum are also needed.\nLarson said the goal is to get the resources so each school can look at its population and ask what students need to get the best education possible.\nThe Oregon Education Association's report includes recommendations that are meant to address the short- and long-term needs in classrooms statewide.\nThree key ideas were prioritized \u2014 increasing onsite student supports with a focus on mental health, reducing class size and caseloads, and fully funding targeted professional development and ongoing supports for implementation.\nEach recommendation includes steps for schools, districts and the state to take.\nFor onsite supports, the association recommends more mental health counselors, school psychologists, social workers, school nurses, speech language pathologists, occupational and physical therapists and other mental health and trauma experts.\nConcerning class size, the state's most recent class size report by the Oregon Department of Education documented 579 classes with 56 or more students.\nAdditionally, almost half of classes are 35 to 51 percent larger than research recommends, according to the department's report.\nOregon Gov. Kate Brown has recommended paying for additional staff in order to reduce class sizes, especially in K-3 classes, where students are not only learning academic basics, but social norms and appropriate behaviors as well.\nAnd for professional development, the association recommends ongoing training and support for staff to \"fully transfer new knowledge into practice.\"\n\"We have inadequate training for new curriculum,\" one teacher told the association. \"Teachers in my school are expected to be doing restorative practices/circles regularly in our classrooms; however, not one hour of training has been given so that teachers do this in a truly inclusive and helpful way.\"\nThe association recommends staff getting thorough and consistent training on models of trauma-informed practices, social and emotional learning programs and positive behavior programs, to name a few.\nThough the report focuses on those three key recommendations, it also includes a number of other ideas that would reportedly help improve safety in schools.\nFamily wraparound services, increased physical movement and clarified protocols for physical intervention and restraint of students are just a few.\nFor more information, go to https://www.oregoned.org/ or contact the Oregon Education Association at 503-684-3300.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What are the three key recommendations included in the report to improve safety in schools?", "cluster": 0, "dist": 0.9757328983878051}

Answer according to: HOPE \u2013 Support was expressed from both the Hope Public Schools Board and the University of Arkansas-Hope Board of Visitors here Thursday night for the development of a standing grades 10-12 collegiate and professions academy on the U of A Hope campus in a re-purposed Johnny Rapert Library Complex on the U of A Hope campus.\nThe concept was discussed in a joint informational meeting of the HPS Board and the UAHT Board of Visitors.\n\u201cRapert Library is the symbol of when this campus transitioned from Red River Vocational-Technical College to the University of Arkansas System,\u201d U of A Hope-Texarkana Chancellor Chris Thomason told some 50 attendees in the Rapert Library auditorium.\nThomason said the partnership already established between U of A Hope and the Hope Public Schools through a concurrent credit program signifies the gravity with which both entities view the opportunity for the unique plan.\n\u201cAt every juncture of our history, there has been the importance of our partnership with the Hope Public Schools,\u201d he said.\nThe concept calls for a direct collaboration between the HPSD and UAHT, housed on the U of A Hope campus, and intended to provide a rigorous college-level program of study for highly-motivated students in grades 10-12 that would produce a Hope High School diploma and a UAHT Associate\u2019s degree at the end of three years.\nClasses would be taught exclusively by UAHT faculty, and a pre-planned course of study would be developed for each student. High school students would be integrated into college classes, with no more than 10 students per class.\nStudents would segue into the full course of study through high school level AP/honors classes and some dual college credit courses. The final two years would consist of dual credit courses and regular college study.\nThomason said HPSD students in the program would still be afforded opportunities in extra-curricular activities both at HHS and on the U of A Hope campus.\nHe said the academy is to be housed in a remodeled Rapert Library Complex which provides independent entry to the academy apart from a redesigned library entrance. Classrooms, offices and the auditorium in the Rapert complex will be for the primary use of the academy, he said.\nThomason said the Rapert Library will consist of a reading room, library stacks, and college book rental. Additional outdoor instructional space is also anticipated in the current preliminary designs for the building\u2019s use, he said.\nThomason said the concept is based on the Northwest Florida State College High School which the UAHT administration and staff have studied.\nHe said the Florida model incorporates five high schools, while the Hope Collegiate and Professions Academy is exclusively focused on the partnership with the Hope Public Schools.\n\u201cWe believe one collaboration with one high school is a much stronger model for success,\u201d Thomason said.\nHPS Superintendent Bobby Hart said the concept would be developed through a \u201cconversion charter\u201d for the academy, bringing Hope High School directly into the model. He noted that statistics have shown both Arkansas and Hempstead County are behind in the level of educational attainment.\n\u201cThere is a direct correlation between education and income,\u201d Hart said.\nHe said Arkansas currently ranks 48th nationally in the percentage of its population with college degrees or certifications, with median income of $41,262 annually. Hempstead County is 62 among 75 counties in college-level attainment, with annual median income of $32,122.\nHart said the collegiate and professions academy \u201cconversion charter\u201d is a means to change the arc of outcomes for Hope and Hempstead County for the next generation.\nHart said the Hope Collegiate and Professions Academy is designed for students living in the Hope Public School District.\nHart said the current timeframe for obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree is five years because of costs, which often require students to work, class scheduling, and family circumstances.\n\u201cThink of the economic potential we\u2019re giving our students at the age of 18,\u201d he said.\nUAHT Dean of Institutional Effectiveness John Hollis said the plan was worked out by a committee including himself, Hope Academy of Public Service Principal Dr. Carol Ann Duke, Yerger Middle School Principal Josclyn Wiley and UAHT Institutional Research Officer Danita Ormand.\nHollis said, if begun now, approvals from the Arkansas Department of Education and the Arkansas Department of Higher Education would mean that the process could be completed by late 2018 or early 2019.\nHe said the mission and vision for the academy have been taken from those of both UAHT and the HPSD to provide for the strongest points of \u201coverlap\u201d between the two.\n\u201cWe want these students to achieve their dreams, whatever they are,\u201d Hollis said.\nThomason said a limited \u201cpilot\u201d class might be possible in the Fall, 2018; and he stressed the support which the plan has already received from the head of the U of A System.\nResponding to questions from both boards, Thomason and Hart emphasized their understanding that the program is designed for 16, 17, 18-year old students to take on college-level academics.\nHart said the core of the academy obviously comes from the HAPS, YMS, and HHS campuses.\nHe emphasized that the collegiate and professions programs which make up the academic DNA of UAHT from its days as Red River Vocational-Technical College provide a practical balance and continued affordability.", "cluster": 0, "dist": 1.0221033500335586}
{"id": 15968, "prompt": "DWI Charge Reduced Because of Tongue Piercing | Villani & DeLuca, P.C.\nA New Jersey woman was charged with drunk driving and provided a breath sample that was three times higher than the legal limit. Kara Nelson, who registered a 0.21% blood alcohol concentration (BAC), was able to argue that the BAC reading result was invalid because New Jersey law requires that people have no foreign materials in their mouth when they take the BAC test.\nNelson had a pierced tongue stud in her mouth during the test, which she argued as a main factor attributing to the high BAC. As a result of the invalidation of her BAC results, Nelson was not forced to the mandatory higher fine and 7 month loss of her driver\u2019s license. Instead, Nelson received the lesser sentence of 3 months loss of her driver\u2019s license and lower fines for a lower tier DWI.\nA judge may still find an individual guilty of drunk driving based merely on field sobriety tests given by police. Some of the field sobriety tests the police may use reciting the alphabet in a requested order, counting out loud, a finger to nose test, balancing with eyes closed, and walking a straight line. The field sobriety tests may or may not be recorded by videotape depending on the availability of the equipment. Most drunk driving cases processed by New Jersey State Troopers are videotaped.\nUpon arrest, based on probable cause that the person was driving while intoxicated, the accused drunk driver will be transported to the police station to provide a sample for the Alcotest. The Alcotest is the current system used in New Jersey to test a suspected drunk driver\u2019s blood alcohol concentration. The Alcotest, consisting of a keyboard, an external printer, and the testing device itself is positioned on a table near where the accused drunk driver is seated.\nAccording to specific New Jersey law, the law enforcement officer operating the Alcotest must observe the defendant for twenty minutes before collecting a breath test sample. The purpose of this rule is to avoid an overestimated reading due to residual effect of mouth alcohol. The software is programmed to prohibit operation of the device before the passage of 20 minutes from the time entered as the time of the arrest. The operator or another present police officer must also observe the person arrested for the required 20 minutes to ensure that no alcohol has entered the person\u2019s mouth while waiting to submit to the breath test.\nAdditionally, if the charged person swallows anything, throws up, spits up, or if the operator notices the individual is chewing gum or tobacco in the person\u2019s mouth, the operator is required to start over counting another 20 minute period.\nThe local police officer or State Trooper about to conduct the Alcotest must confirm that the suspected drunk driver has no foreign objects in his or her mouth. A foreign object in the individual\u2019s mouth has the possibility to cause a high blood alcohol concentration result. The law enforcement officer should confirm there is no gum, chew or breath mint in the person\u2019s mouth during the 20 minute observation period before the test is administered.\nDental implants, retainers or dentures could also cause an inaccurate BAC reading to be produced. The law enforcement officer should therefore also confirm that the person does not have a retainer around their teeth. The presence of foreign objects in someone\u2019s mouth has the possibility of absorbing and retaining alcohol and other chemicals that may cause an inaccurate reading.\nIf you have been charged with a DWI or DUI in New Jersey, you need to call an experienced New Jersey criminal defense attorney to protect your rights.

{"id": 20928, "prompt": "The ashes of the young man killed in the high-profile car crash involving polo magnate John Goodman can't be legally divided among his divorced, feuding parents, a state appeals court has ruled in a decision released Wednesday.\nThe remains of Scott Wilson are not \"property\" that can be halved into two equal parts, the three-judge panel at the Fourth District Court of Appeal said, a ruling in favor of Wilson's mother, who opposed the division of her son's ashes on religious grounds.\nThe decision cited debate about human remains dating back to the 1700s, prior cases in Florida, and the state's existing legislation. But the court's decision, quoting the words of a fellow judge from a similar case in 2005, couldn't ignore the sheer emotion of the case.\n\"It is a sorrowful matter to have relatives disputing in court over the remains of the deceased,\" Judge Martha Warner wrote. \"In this case in particular, there is no solution that will bring peace to all parties.\"\nThe court also said the \"sensitive policy issue\" \u2014 whether remains could be treated the same as a body, or considered property \u2014 would be best left to the Florida legislature to decide.\nScott Wilson, of Wellington, was 23 when he died on Feb. 12, 2010. That night, he was driving his Hyundai Sonata at the intersection of 120th Avenue and Lake Worth Road, when a Bentley driven by Goodman sped through a stop sign, striking the Sonata, according to trial evidence. Wilson's car was pushed into a canal and he died.\nAnd while the Goodman case has been winding its way through the courts, so too has the legal fight between Scott Wilson's parents over their son's remains.\nThe decision offers a general summary of the circumstances, explaining that William Wilson Jr., Scott's father, and Lili Wilson, Scott's mother, were divorced at the time of their son's death.\nWhile they had agreed to cremate Scott, they couldn't agree on how to distribute Scott's ashes, the court noted. The young man didn't leave a will or any instructions on how to treat his remains. Meanwhile the ashes remained in an urn at a Royal Palm Beach funeral home.\nLili Wilson wanted to bury her son's remains in West Palm Beach, where Scott had spent his entire life moving away to study engineering at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.\nScott's father sought to bury his son's ashes in a family plot in Blue Ridge, Ga., a place that Scott had visited many times in his youth.\nIn his efforts to have the remains legally divided, William Wilson Jr. asked a court to deem the ashes property so that they could then be partitioned under the probate code, the appeals court decision states. His ex-wife opposed such a move.\nUltimately, the lower court disagreed with William Wilson's property argument and denied the petition. The court then issued an ultimatum: find a way to dispose of the remains in 30 days or the court would appoint somebody to do it instead. Wilson's father then brought the case to the appeals court, which resulted in Wednesday's decision.\nIt's likely that the case will now go back to the lower court.\nLili Wilson's attorney, Kristina Pett, declined to comment, citing her client's wishes.\nWilliam Wilson's lawyer, Joy Bartmon, said she was disappointed with the decision.\n\"This opinion does not guide the trial court in the determination to be made,\" she said in an email. \"Instead, what will occur when the decision as to the ashes goes back to the trial court, is what I wanted to avoid. The final resting place for this young man may be left to the discretion of an administrator who never knew him.\"\nAs for Goodman, a jury convicted him of driving drunk and causing Wilson's death in March 2012. Last year, however, Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath tossed Goodman's conviction and 16-year prison sentence because of juror misconduct.\nThe 50-year old multimillionaire founder of International Polo Club Palm Beach is on house arrest on $4 million bail while his attorneys continue to challenge evidence in the case before the new trial.\nWilliam and Lili Wilson's civil lawsuit against Goodman settled two years ago; the parents evenly split $46 million, before attorney fees, according to court records.

{"id": 10400, "prompt": "Here is a piece of text: NINETEEN seventy-eight was the year when Lamar Alexander first discovered the political power of flannel.\nThe young, ambitious lawyer was running hard for governor of Tennessee and had grown weary of the usual politicos and party fund-raisers. So he ditched old campaign methods, slipped on a red-and-black lumberjack shirt, khakis, and broken-in boots, and hiked 1,000 miles, crisscrossing the state from Memphis to Knoxville.\nMr. Alexander's aim, he said, was to meet ''real'' people, tell them who he was, and hear their solutions to problems. It worked - spectacularly. After two popular tours in the Tennessee statehouse, Alexander earned a reputation as a rising Republican star. President Bush brought him to Washington as secretary of education.\nSo when Alexander launched his own bid for the presidency a year ago, it seemed only natural that he begin by pounding the pavement. This time it's New Hampshire voters who've seen him amble up to their farmhouses and saunter around their historic town commons, all the while dressed like an ad for L.L. Bean.\nBut Alexander has encountered only tepid support in early primary states. When he ends a 100-mile trek from Concord, N.H., to the Granite State coast on Feb. 19, the gathering is likely to be small. Most of the state will be inside by the fire, watching Forbes's TV ads.\nMagazine publisher Steve Forbes, a political neophyte, has preempted Alexander's hoped-for image as the race's Mr. Outsider. Media interest in other issues, from Gen. Colin Powell's not-quite campaign to budget wrangling in Washington, has kept Alexander and other second-tier candidates off the evening news, making it difficult to build crucial name recognition.\nThough he was among the first to crank up his campaign and float his image on TV, Alexander remains back in the pack with only weeks to go until the nation's first primary here.\nFor the self-proclaimed Washington outsider noted for his tenacity and not completely discounted by observers yet, the next few weeks may reveal if the optimism and hope of his stump speeches can finally be translated into votes.\nTom Rath, a New Hampshire strategist on Alexander's side, remains warily confident. ''Early on, there was an internal decision to stick to the plan and not panic. This campaign, if it was ever going to be successful, was going to be successful at the end,'' he says.\nAlexander insists he's the only candidate who can beat President Clinton and would solve the country's problems by shipping authority back to the states.\n''I would like to be the president that leads us into the next century expecting less from Washington and more of ourselves,'' he offers.\nHe uses his experience as governor - ''I believe I'm the only one running for president who's ever balanced [a budget]'' - and as a businessman to set himself apart from GOP rivals. ''Every politician ought to be sentenced to try to live and work under the rules set up while in office,'' he says, referring to a day-care business he started after serving as governor.\nEducation is one of the cornerstones of his platform. Alexander draws on his experience as University of Tennessee president and US secretary of education when he calls for school choice and privatization. He proposes to close the Education Department he once led.\nBut Alexander's overarching message is the need to reduce the power of the federal government. Though he says he opposes abortion and gun control, his belief that states should address these issues is so strong that he would not support federal legislation on them. ''We know what to do,'' he says of local politicians, and referring to the name of his newest book.\nAlexander is a slight man with an assuring voice and just a touch of a Southern accent. When he speaks to a crowd, his movements are restrained; he appeals to an audience through logic, not emotion. But he's a talented storyteller, and his addresses are peppered with yarns of his youth.\nAndrew Lamar Alexander was reared in small-town Tennessee amid the dogwoods, the deer, and the scenic vistas of the Great Smoky Mountains. In Maryville, Tenn., Alexander led a childhood of paper routes and Fourth of July parades, piano lessons and snowball fights.\nHe credits his parents, scout masters, teachers, Sunday school, and neighbors with keeping him too busy to be in trouble. If children could grow up that way now, he says, many problems of today's youths would solve themselves.\nAfter clerking with a judge in New Orleans (where Alexander moonlighted as a musician on Bourbon Street), he began to traffic in political circuits. Alexander wound up under the wing of not-yet-elected Sen. Howard Baker, with whom he has since forged a lifelong friendship. Alexander then spent the next 11 years Ping- Ponging between Washington and Nashville politics.\nIn 1979, he began his first term as governor. Four years later, he was easily reelected. After attracting the Nissan and Saturn automobile plants to his state, helping to cut Tennessee's government employees and debt, enacting a merit-pay system for teachers, and lowering the tax rate to the nation's fifth lowest, the consensus was that Alexander could have won a third term if not for the law holding governors to two terms.\nAlexander fans say his civility and sincerity are what make him a different breed of politician. He's the kind of man described as comforting - and is likened to such figures as Mr. Rogers and the TV father of Patty Duke.\n''Is he a down-to-earth, practical, common sense ... man who feels as comfortable with the working man as someone in high office,'' asks Ted Welch, Alexander's chief fund-raiser and longtime friend. ''The answer is absolutely yes.\nBut observers and pollsters say no one gets elected for being nice. Alexander, they say, has not captured the nation's attention. The wind from his early mantra of ''cut their pay and send them home'' went out of his sails with the '94 congressional elections, when voters showed their distaste of Washington by voting out scores of politicians.\nWhat Alexander does have going for him is a well-financed campaign. He has six of the last eight finance chairmen of the Republican National Committee on his side. Tennesseans have given more money to presidential campaigns than any state except Texas.\nBut money is also an issue that, if Alexander becomes a serious contender, may plague him. In his confirmation hearings for secretary of education in 1991, critics raised questions of how Alexander earned the money that's made him a millionaire. Democrats made allegations - all denied by Alexander who was easily confirmed - that while governor and president of the University of Tennessee he profited from his positions by making real estate investments based on information not available to the public.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What are some criticisms and concerns surrounding Lamar Alexander's wealth and financial history?", "cluster": 0, "dist": 0.9845599455370707}
{"id": 21056, "prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can you summarize the joint partnership between the Elmhurst Memorial Hospital and the Elmhurst Park District in operating the new Courts Plus athletic facility?\n\nPassage: Elmhurst resident Edward Landmesser Jr. stretched his arms over his head and inhaled deeply. The middle-aged man was gratefully cooling down after an exercise routine that he does regularly at Courts Plus, a new 78,000-square-foot athletic facility operated by the Elmhurst Park District.\nUnlike many of the other 1,700 members of the center, Landmesser and some 20 other participants of the exercise class then had their blood pressure checked and an electrocardiogram performed by a registered nurse.\nThree years ago, Landmesser suffered a heart attack. Since then, he has been taking part in Elmhurst Memorial Hospital`s cardiac rehabilitation program. The hospital classes are now at the park district`s fitness center.\nJoint use of the state-of-the-art exercise facility by the hospital and the park district is a unique cooperation between a governmental entity and a private one that is benefitting both.\nThe association between the hospital and the park district ''integrates health, rehabilitation and education into a fitness setting. It becomes more of an overall wellness center,'' said Victor Arellano, manager of the LifePlan Center.\nThe hospital`s campus, at 200 N. Berteau Ave., on the city`s east side, is ''landlocked,'' according to Arellano. Space is at a premium on the hospital campus, which is in a residential area, he said.\nThe hospital`s space at the fitness center will enable it to expand its community service programs and will provide them a permanent home.\nIn the past, Arellano said, the hospital operated its cardiac rehabilitation program wherever it could. It has been held at the Elmhurst YMCA, York High School and Elmhurst College.\n''Courts Plus also has nice amenities and access to more exercise equipment,'' Arellano said.\n''I think its great. This is much nicer and its air-conditioned,'' said Landmesser, who is delighted that during the ''dog days'' of next summer he will not be walking outside as he did last summer at the Elmhurst College track.\nThe facility, which was built in 1971 as an indoor tennis/racquet ball club, was expanded to include a five-lane, 25-yard swimming pool, a four-lane running track, an aerobics room, steam rooms and increased locker room space. Officials of the park district and the hospital are hoping that the other will provide access to an audience that they may not otherwise have reached.\nAn individual membership at the center for an Elmhurst resident requires a $75 deposit and monthly payments of $25. Pope said the district is hoping to sign up 2,350 members by next year. The center opened last month.\nUser fees will be dedicated to paying for the operational costs of the facility and for 30 percent of capital cost of constructing the $4.5 million facility.\nThe cost of renovation of the hospital`s space in the center is $288,000. In the first year of its six-year user agreement with the park district, the hospital will pay $53,000 for its space.\nThe ''spinoff'' theory Pope is counting on to build membership at Courts Plus is already working. Landmesser`s wife, Marianne, has joined the facility to accompany her husband in his workouts.", "cluster": 0, "dist": 0.9906979219392322}

{"id": 9408, "prompt": "Can you summarize the results of the study on online clinical mentoring for novice clinicians treating patients with spinal dysfunction in the outpatient setting?: Objectives: Clinical mentoring is important for novice clinicians as they are developing advanced critical-thinking skills. Research exploring innovative mentoring strategies to reduce barriers and enhance learning is needed. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of providing online clinical mentoring to small international groups of novice clinicians treating patients with spinal dysfunction in the outpatient setting.\nMethods: Eleven novice and four expert clinicians were allocated into small international groups. Four one-hour group video-conference mentoring sessions were held in which each novice clinician presented a case study. Data were collected from pre- and post-participation surveys and post-participation focus groups. Data were evaluated with a mixed-methods phenomenological analysis.\nResults: Four themes emerged from the novice qualitative data: improved confidence, enhanced critical thinking, appreciation of the structured design and accessibility to peers and mentors. The quantitative data revealed significant improvement in three confidence measures, improvement of 1.48 points on self-selected clinical goals, and 82.0% reported improved clinical decision-making. Two themes emerged from the expert data: value of the model to fill a need within the profession and viability of the model to stand alone or as part of an educational program. All participants rated their experience on average at 8.76/10 and expressed interest in future mentoring programs.\nDiscussion: Online small group international clinical mentoring appears to be an effective strategy to provide clinical mentoring to promote confidence and critical-thinking skills. This research could provide a viable model to increase accessibility to clinical mentors and fill a need within the profession.\nWestervelt, Karen ; Hing, Wayne A ; McGovern, Mary Claire ; Banks, Lora ; Carney, Carolyn ; Kunker, Katrina ; Magoon, Ashley ; Sibold, Jeremy ; Crane, Linda H. / An Online Model of International Clinical Mentoring for Novice Physical Therapists.

{"id": 21952, "prompt": "(c) 2014, Glen Downey, All rights reserved.\nSome Takeaways from \"I Witness: How Graphic Storytellers Are Teaching Us About the World and How We See It\"\nIf you're planning to teach a major work of travel literature in your high school English course or perhaps even an entire unit with travel as a focus, you might consider the possibility of going graphic. As we explored in \"I Witness,\" a workshop at 2014 CITE Conference, graphic travelogues and graphic memoirs with a significant travel focus can provide a perspective on \"the journey\" that is unique to the genre of visual narrative. Because these writers and artists must show the visual context of the story they are telling, and because the context -- to be believed -- must actually look authentic, there often seems to be a tendency on the part of the graphic travel writer to let the place they are visiting (or indeed \"bearing witness to\") tell its own story.\nI feel like this whenever I read Guy Delisle's Pyongyang or the Ricard Brothers' Beirut 1990 or Florent Chavouet's Tokyo on Foot. While it is true that I learn about these writers' experiences through their work, I learn so much more about the place they are visiting as though the place itself were speaking to me.\nThe visual brainstorming above provides a small snapshot of the ideas that come to mind when we begin to think both about travel lit and the graphic memoir. We can see that there are tremendous possibilities for making connections between the travel literature of old and those found in today's graphic travelogues. In your next travel literature unit, why NOT feature excerpts from The Wanderer, The Seafarer, Gulliver's Travels, A Pilgrim's Progress, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Into the Wild, Palestine, Pyongyang, Tokyo on Foot, and Safe Area Goradze? You can throw in A Walk in the Woods, The Fixer, Beirut 1990, and Into Thin Air for good measure. What I'm advocating is not to use graphic travel literature merely as a way to supplement your teaching of a traditional travel novel, but to include it as an equal partner in the discussion of how we write about travel.\nFor those who didn't get a chance to attend the workshop, here's the handout!\nCan you summarize the main argument of \"I Witness\" and explain how graphic travelogues and memoirs can provide a unique perspective on the travel genre?", "cluster": 6, "dist": 1.1393750558107532}

{"id": 22880, "prompt": "Can you suggest a substitute for refined white sugar in the cream cheese pastry blueberry-apple cobbler recipe? Answer according to: Dennys Food and Recipes: Summer Food: Cream Cheese Pastry Blueberry-Apple Cobbler and Traditional Blueberry Cobbler: From Denny: Blueberries. The awesome blue food we all love. So, I went hunting for something interesting in the cobbler department for us this week. The first recipe is from our local newspaper, a blueberry cobbler made with a cream cheese pastry and a filling that consists of a combination of blueberries, apple and lemon. A cream cheese pastry always tastes great with a fruit filling, especially blueberries! It's a simple and straightforward pastry recipe with flour, salt and butter but also with cream cheese and a bit of orange juice added to the pastry to spike up the flavor.\nThe filling calls for fresh blueberries, an apple and lemon juice and lemon zest. While this recipe calls for sugar I often substitute brown rice syrup or agave syrup in its place for a lower glycemic index than refined white sugar. Try it half sugar and half agave as an idea, whatever you like at your house, just try experimenting until you find that sweet spot Goldilocks zone for your taste buds!\nThe second recipe is a traditional blueberry cobbler made in a 9-inch square baking pan like you do for brownies and is from a local Louisiana blueberry grower. When a recipe calls for margarine, well, I'm no fan of margarine, so I use clarified butter. If you don't have the time to make your own clarified butter it's now available in grocery stores as I saw a jar in Trader Joe's just last week.\nAlso note that I use \"Tablespoon\" and \"teaspoon\" as an easier read so you don't get confused by small type - by writing it out instead of an abbreviation and also capitalizing Tablespoon. There have been those moments when I was busy and scan read a recipe only to make a mistake with too much or too little of an ingredient so I changed all my recipes to reflect what I do here on my food blogs. The whole point is to enjoy a good food experience!", "cluster": 8, "dist": 0.8717066112016318}
